# deep-neural-network-with-numpy
Are you bored with using all the built in functions for neural networks ??
The implementation is as neural network and it is flexible to add as many as hidden layers.
The this classifier model is evaluated with titanic dataset(preprossed).
As the dataset is biased you can't find the difference in performance of Deep layered model
use it for other unbaised dataset or image dataset you can surely see deeplayered neural network performing well over logistic regression
you can use it as regressor also by changing the last layer to linear
feel free to tune hyper parameters like learning rate(lr),regularization parameter(lambd)
